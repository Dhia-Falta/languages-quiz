languages quiz using Php, Mysql, jquery
## <a href="http://doudoufalta.com/works/languages-school/test.php">View demo</a>

A client requests a quiz of 7 different languages for his School.
So this test is my first try using jquery, and I know it's not the best practice to create a quiz (main.js file is too big) but it works very well anyway.
